# Connecting to the hosted service

There are 3 hosted services available, UAT, staging and production.  
* UAT and staging talk to the HMRC sandbox and contain fake users and fake, uploaded by us, data.  
* Production talks to the live HMRC APIs

UAT is accessible from any computer, whereas staging and production require the use of the MOJ - DSD VPN to connect

To request any/all of the following:
* a set of credentials for any of these instances 
* the list of user values that will return data for the non-production hosted instances

visit the #laa-hmrc-interface slack channel and drop us a message
